- wrong title (sorry)
- this is ETL storage, just to be for-warned.
- problem
-- our schema sucked
--- source => diffrent DB for 'same' info
---- cascade lookups
---- data gaps
- goal
-- single location
-- source every data point
=> over normalize everything
- pros!
-- reports, cake!
-- debugging data, cake!
-- specialized data use, cake!
- cons!
-- slow! to read from
--- SOLUTION: summary tables currently, possibly KV store down the road
--- HIDDEN PRO: abstraction for reads means you can bomb your data (2 day alter table, sure!)
-- complex structure => staff confusion
--- SOLUTION: abstract everything to code (hello ORM)
--- HIDDEN PRO: abstraction means you are free to change schema at will.
