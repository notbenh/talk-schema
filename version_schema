= Completely vertical versonable schema = 

== why ==

* Many sources
** varying levels of trust
** trust can change at a later date
** need to have the ability to slice out entire sources
* different ways to look at the data.

== advantages ==

* source every 'cell'
* trust for every 'cell'

== disadvantage ==

* not a 'normal' looking schema
** requires traning
** helps to abstract the crazyness (code)
* slow slow slow
** requires the use of summary tables to be useful (not the worst thing but yet another layer)




Talk to the county library see if they have any ideas on storing data and possibly see about sharing data?
